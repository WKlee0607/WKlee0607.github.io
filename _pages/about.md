Iâ€™m an M.S. candidate in the Department of Artificial Intelligence at Kyung Hee University (Republic of Korea), working in the Visual Science Lab. I received my B.S. in 2025 from Kyung Hee University with a double major in Space Science and Astronomy and Software Convergence. My research interests include sound source localization, video anomaly detection, and multimodal representation learning. Most recently, my work has focused on cross-domain object detection.
